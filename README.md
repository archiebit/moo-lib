## About
I want to learn how C++ works. Here will be my implementations of some things.
Maybe they will not be so good, but I don't care. I want to try to use them in my future small projects.

Since I use Windows, the implementation details will be written in WinAPI.
And I chose Clang compiler for this project.

## Features
Right now I am trying to make this project without runtime library. For fun.
Here is a list of some features I want to add.

| Feature                   | Implemented            | Description                                         |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Custom exception handling | <ul><li>[ ] </li></ul> | Uses setjmp/longjmp technique                       |
| Memory management         | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul> |                                                     |
| Program startup           | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul> | Proper initialization of `static` variables         |
| Thread local storage      | <ul><li>[x] </li></ul> | Proper initialization of `thread_local` variables   |
| Sequential containers     | <ul><li>[ ] </li></ul> | Something like array, linked list, stack, et cetera |

The list will grow.
